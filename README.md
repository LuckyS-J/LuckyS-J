### Hey! 👋  
I'm diving into Python and exploring different areas of programming. Right now, I'm especially curious about Data Science and backend development.  

🐍 Playing around with Flask and SQLAlchemy  
📊 Just starting with data analysis and visualization  
💡 Learning step by step and building small projects along the way  

Currently figuring things out and having fun with coding. 🚀
